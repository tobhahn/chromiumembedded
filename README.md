chromiumembedded
================

A git-svn clone of https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded

This repo tracks the development in the original svn repo; it
is **not** a fork of chromiumembedded.

At the time of this writing, _git_ does not support cloning
repos created with _git svn_ (and keeping the svn metadata).
The man page recommends to use _rsync_ instead, which won't
work with github for obvious reasons. So if this clone seems
horribly out of date compared to the svn repo, feel free to
ping me and I'll try to _git svn fetch_ ASAP :-)
